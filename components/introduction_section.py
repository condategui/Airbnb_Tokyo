    ## What is Airbnb?

Founded in 2008, Airbnb has grown to become a major player in the travel and hospitality industry, offering a wide variety of lodging options in destinations around the world.
    
    ### Key Facts:

    - **Listings**: Over 7 million

    ## Airbnb's History
    
    Airbnb was founded in August 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk. The idea for the company came about when Chesky and Gebbia, struggling to pay rent for their San Francisco loft, decided to turn their living room into a bed and breakfast for conference attendees. They rented out air mattresses on their floor and provided homemade breakfast, thus the name "Air Bed & Breakfast" was born.
    
    The company quickly expanded, and by 2009, it had secured its first round of funding from Y Combinator. Over the years, Airbnb has grown exponentially, expanding into new markets and adding various types of accommodations, including entire homes, unique stays (like treehouses and castles), and boutique hotels.
    
    Today, Airbnb is a global phenomenon, with millions of hosts and guests using the platform to arrange stays in over 220 countries and regions. The company's growth has not been without challenges, including regulatory issues and competition from traditional hotel chains, but Airbnb continues to innovate and adapt, offering new services such as "Experiences" and "Airbnb Plus" to enhance the travel experience.
